<p>Listboxer is the result of an idea I had to decouple email newsletters from the email inbox. It basically acts as a public inbox where people can come and discover newsletters before subscribing to them. There is a lot of good content out there that is currently silo-ed and hidden from discovery. Lots of really smart people are creating amazing stuff but it&#39;s hidden away from view. Imagine a twitter that doesn&#39;t require you to do anything but send out the emails you&#39;re already creating.</p>
